## Classifier methods on IRIS Dataset - Deep Learning Included
We did perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Iris dataset before, here this link:


Now we will implement classifier methods as a benchmark for Iris dataset. It will be a live script which I will try to update weekly with different methods and try to improve method's accuracy.
Just for start, it includes K-means & Decision tree classifier and also a Deep Learning-Neural Network predictor for classification.

Iris dataset is the best known dataset in the machine learning literature. It contains 150
samples, 50 samples for each of the 3 classes. Class labels are given in the last column of the
dataset as integer values and 0, 1, 2 refers to setosa, versicolor, virginica respectively.
