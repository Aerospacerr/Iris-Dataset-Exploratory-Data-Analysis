## Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Decision Tree Classifier 
We are going to perform a exploratory data analysis (EDA) on iris dataset 
Then we will implement a decision tree classifier, train with iris dataset 
Finally analyze the results of the classification

Iris dataset is the best known dataset in the machine learning literature. It contains 150
samples, 50 samples for each of the 3 classes. Class labels are given in the last column of the
dataset as integer values and 0, 1, 2 refers to setosa, versicolor, virginica respectively.
